ADSP-2191 STUD-1: Character set demo of the C Application Programming Interface 

The STUD-1 is a single-board computer equipped with Analog Devices ADSP-2191 processor, LCD display, audio input/output and rotating controls. The STUD-1 intended for development of small audio signal processing applications. Such development is hard to do in ADSP-2191 assembly language. The C Application Programming Interface enables an easier ride for the developer.

This small C application demonstrates the character set on the LCD display using the C Application Programming Interface.
